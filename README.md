# SCHOOL - Project

## DESCRIPTION  
The **Popeye** project is focused on implementing a simulation of a character performing repetitive tasks in a loop, inspired by operating systems and process management.  
The goal is to create a system where a character (Popeye) consumes spinach to gain strength, performs tasks, and returns to a rest state, following a specific sequence of events.

---

## FEATURES  
- **Task automation:**  
  - Popeye performs predefined tasks in a loop.  
- **Spinach consumption:**  
  - Popeye consumes spinach periodically to maintain strength.  
- **State management:**  
  - Transition between states (working, eating, resting).  
- **Error handling:**  
  - Program exits with error codes if unexpected conditions occur.

  `malloc`, `free`, `exit`,  
  `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`,  
  `usleep`, `signal`, `kill`,
